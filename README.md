# **CryptoClustering**

This is the repository that holds my Module 19 CryptoClustering

## **Module Overview**
In this challenge, we were asked to use our Python and unsupervised learning knowledge to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. As part of this challenge, we were asked to:
- Find the Best Value for k by Using the Scaled DataFrame
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Scaled DataFrame
- Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA DataFrame
- Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA DataFrame
- Visualize and Compare the Results-

### **The main “CryptoClustering” repo contains the following files and subfolders:**
1. **“Crypto_Clustering.ipynb” file** which holds my challenge code.
2. **“.vscode” subfolder** which holds a “settings.json” file.
3. **“Resources” subfolder** which holds the “crypto_market_data.csv” dataset.

Please note, I used in-class activities/notes to complete the challenge.
